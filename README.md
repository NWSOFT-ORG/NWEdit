        Pyro currently does a very minimalist job of text editing via tcl/tk ala tkinter. 
        
        What pyro does now:
        
           colorizes syntax for a variety of text types; to wit:
    
               Python
               PlainText
               Html/Javascript
               Xml
               Html/Php
               Perl6
               Ruby
               Ini/Init
               Apache 'Conf'
               Bash Scripts
               Diffs
               C#
               MySql
           
           writes out its buffer
           converts tabs to 4 spaces
           
           It does this in an austere text editor framework which is essentially a glue layer
           bringing together the tk text widget with the Pygment library for styling displayed
           text. _Editor status line is in the window title.
           
           Pyro comes with one serious warning: it is a user-space editor. It makes no effort
           to monitor state-change events on files and so should not be used in situations
           where it is possible that more than one writer will have access to the file.
           
           
        Pyro's current controls are as follows:
        
           Ctrl+q quits
           Ctrl+w writes out the buffer
           Selection, copy, cut and paste are all per xserver/window manager. Keyboard navigation via
           arrow/control keys, per system READLINE.
           
        Pyro's current commands are:
        
           #(num) move view to line 'num' and highlight it, if possible.
           *(text) find text in file.
           /(delim)(text)(delim)(text) search and replace
        
        Pyro requires Tkinter and Pygment external libraries.

Thanks to overture for the phplint tool, and thanks to people who wrote greate code on Gist and stack overflow.

# Installing dependencies

This editor needs a **LOT** of dependencies.  
I have installed a lot.  
However, to make sure that it works fully, you need to install them  
Dependencies:

- npm -> eslint (for JavaScript)
- autopep8
- pylint
- html-linter
- ttkthemes
- Pygments You can install them using the following commands:  
  `poetry install && npm install` (Works on Linux, Mac, and Windows)  
  To get Poetry, go here: [python-poetry/poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation)

# How it works

You can find clues about how it works, initializes etc. in the log file.

## How it updates:

This editor uses the magical requests module to get a file from remote.  
It is at [here](https://zcg-coder.github.io/NWSOFT/PyPlusWeb/ver.json).  
Then it reads the text, parse it, and determine if there's an update.

## How the syntax highlight works:

This editor uses pygments as its syntax highlighter.  
When it initilizes, it reads the general-settings.json file at the Settings directory  
There should be a key, which tells it the syntax highlight theme  
When a file is opened, it will read another json, called lexer-settings.json.  
It tells pygments the correct lexer to use.  
When a key is pressed, it recolorizes the text.  
It creates the tags, then configure them to make the text's color look different.

## How it handle exeptions

The exceptions will get logged into a file, and I debug it by looking in the log file.  
I'll try to make the logs contain as much info as I can.  
If you want to know if the editor works, view the log! If it works, the log should start with:

```
INFO:pyplus:Tkinter version: 8.6
DEBUG:pyplus:All modules imported
DEBUG:pyplus:Settings loaded
DEBUG:pyplus:Theme loaded
DEBUG:pyplus:Menu created
DEBUG:pyplus:Right-click menu created
DEBUG:pyplus:Tab right-click menu created
DEBUG:pyplus:Bindings created
DEBUG:pyplus:Start screen created
```
# What I learnt from developing it
- Some methods look extremely tricky, but they solve the problem!
- Sometimes it's a good idea to reference other people's code.
