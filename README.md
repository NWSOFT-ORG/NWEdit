> The editor that edits.

## Introduction

NWEdit is a multipurpose editor written in Python.\
We try to make an editor that satisfies your needs, but doesn't have all that excess clutter that bloats up the size\
It's not pure Python though, because it has a few components written
in Node.js. We're working on making it pure Python, so that it compiles cross-platform.
