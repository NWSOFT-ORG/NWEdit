            <h1>Punch</h1>

            <p>To make punch of any sort in perfection, the ambrosial essence of the lemon most be extracted by rubbing lumps of sugar on the rind, which breaks the delicate little vessels that contain the essence, and at the same time absorbs it. This, and making the mixture sweet and strong, using tea instead of water, and thoroughly amalgamating all the compounds, so that the taste of neither the bitter, the sweet, the spirit,- nor the element, shall be perceptible one over the other, is the grand secret, only to be acquired by practice.</p>
            <p>In making hot toddy, or hot punch, you must put in the spirits before the water: in cold punch, grog, &c., the other way.</p>
            <p>The precise portions of spirit and water, or even of the acidity and sweetness, can have no general rule, as scarcely two persons make punch alike.</p>

            <h1>The Cobbler</h1>

            <p>Like the julep, this delicious potation is an American invention, although it is now a favorite in all warm climates. The "cobbler" does not require much skill in compounding, but to make it acceptable to the eye, as well as to the palate, it is necessary to display Home taste in ornamenting the glass after the beverage is made. We give an illustration showing how a cobbler should look when made to suit an epicure.</p>

            <h1>Juleps</h1>

            <img src="./mint-julep.jpg">

            <p>The julep is peculiarly an American beverage, and in the Southern states is more popular than any other. It was introduced into England by Captain Marryatt, where it is now quite a favorite. The gallant captain seems to have had a penchant for the nectarous drink, and publish- ed the recipe in his work on America. We give it in his own words: "I must descant a little upon the mint julep, as it is, with the thermometer at 100°, one of the most delightful and insinuating potations that ever was invented, and may be drunk with equal satisfaction when the thermometer is as low as 70°. There are many varieties, such as those composed of claret, Madeira, &c. ; but the ingredients of the real mint julep are as follows. I learned how to make them, and succeeded pretty well. Put into a tumbler about a dozen sprigs of the tender shoots of mint, upon them put a spoonful of white sugar, and equal pro- portions of peach and common brandy, so as to fill it up one-third, or perhaps a little less. Then take rasped or pounded ice, and fill up the tumbler. Epicures rub the lips of the tumbler with a piece of fresh pineapple, and the tumbler itself is very often encrusted outside with stalactites of ice. As the ice melts, you drink. I once over- heard two ladies talking in the next room to me, and one of them said, * Well, if I have a weakness for any one thing, it is for a mint julep!' — a very amiable weakness, and proving her good sense and good taste. _ They are, in fact, like the American ladies, irresistible."</p>

            <h2>Mint Julep</h2>

            <p class="serving">Use large bar glass.</p>

            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>1 table-spoonful of white pulverized sugar.</li>
                <li>2½ do. water, mix well with a spoon.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="making">
                <p>Take three or four sprigs of fresh mint, and press them well in the sugar arid water, until the flavor of the mint is extracted; add one and a half wine-glass of Cognac brandy, and fill the glass with fine shaved ice, then draw out the sprigs of mint and insert them in the ice with the stems downward, so that the leaves will be above, in the shape of a bouquet ; arrange berries, and small pieces of sliced orange on top in a tasty manner, dash with Jamaica rum, and sprinkle white sugar on top. Place a straw as represented in the cut, and you have a julep that is fit for an emperor.</p>
